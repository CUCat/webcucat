The main event is the exchange of gifts between sweethearts, loved ones and colleagues. Historically, men gave women roses, and women gave men a book to celebrate the occasionâ€”"a rose for love and a book forever." In modern times, the mutual exchange of books is also customary.</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="lead">Peter J. Balsells was born in Barcelona. He moved to the United States as a teenager and graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder in 1952 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering. In 1958, he and his wife foundedÂ Bal Seal Engineering, Inc., which has its primary facility near Irvine, California and a secondary facility near Colorado Springs, Colorado and makes devices and components for a wide range of engineering and medical applications. Pete received a Distinguished Engineering Alumni Award from CU-Boulder in 2005 and an Honorary Doctorate in 2015.</p>
                   
                    <p> In 1996, a Balsells Fellowship Program was established by Pete Balsells in the School of Engineering at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). Matching support is provided by the Generalitat de Catalunya and by UCI. Since that time, similar programs have been added at CU-Boulder, the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) and the University of California, Davis (UCD). Over 71 mobility students, 139 graduate fellows and 11 postdoctoral fellows have been supported by the programs.</p>
                    <p>In 2010, a Balsells Fellowship Program was established at the University of Colorado Boulder, Peteâ€™s alma mater. The College of Engineering and Applied Science at CUÂ Boulder is the top-ranked engineering college in the greater Rocky Mountain region and is known for hands-on learning, as exemplified by its award-winning Integrated Teaching and Learning Laboratory (opened in 1997) and Discovery Learning Center (opened in 2002). Its vision for excellence in education and research revolves around the paradigm of Engineering for Global Society, including grand challenges in areas such as energy, the environment, and health care. A particular strength of CU is biological science and engineering, through a partnership of science and engineering departments on the Boulder campus and the medical, pharmacy and dental schools on the Denver campus.</p>
